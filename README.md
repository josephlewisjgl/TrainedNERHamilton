# TrainedNERHamilton

Updating the NER model provided by SpaCy with Hamilton Lyrics.

This project notebook is a tutorial covered in my blog. 

I use the SpaCy pretrained model and update it to perform NER on Hamilton. As the SpaCy model has not seen a muscial corpus before this a perfect chance to train
and update the model to get some really accurate tagging on Hamilton lyrics.
